- Exception handling: display messages nicely with a StaticText that can be

  file, then some kind of ordered list of HWNDs we've seen before in this
  running session
- Widow List: need to avoid tooltips from Visual Studio, the thumbnail pop-ups
  on the taskbar, etc.
- Need a way to view a list of displays
